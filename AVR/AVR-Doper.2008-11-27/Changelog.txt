This file documents changes in the software, firmware and hardware of the
AVR-Doper project. New entries are always appended to the end of the file.
Scroll down to the bottom to see the most recent changes.

* Release 2006-07-18

- Added compatibility macros to allow ATMega88 instead of ATMega8.
- Ignore synchLoops parameter in ISP mode since avrdude sometimes sends 0.
- Changed default ISP clock speed to 2 (instead of fastest).

* Release 2006-09-12

- Added patch for avrdude to support HID mode.
- Updated Readme file with information about HID mode and avrdude.

* Release 2006-10-23

- Fixed bug in ISP value polling. Value polling is used when programming older
  devices such as the AT90S8515.

* Release 2007-02-01

- Updated to newest AVR-USB driver version.
- Connected pins 2 and 3 of 8 pin programming socket because these pins are
  swapped on some devices.
- License is now GPL2

* Release 2007-03-29

- Insert "Load Extended Address" command when bit 31 of address is set.
- avrdebug accepts keyboard input now.
- avrdebug works in HID mode and CDC mode now.

* Release 2007-08-07

- Fixed serious bug in SPI-MULTI command. When reading fuses, AVR-Doper sent
  256 uninitialized bytes (content of last buffer) to the device which could
  have unpredictable effects (including chip erase or similar nasty things).
- Fixed bug in HVSP circuit: 14 pin socket must connect pins 11, 12 and 13 to
  GND in order to enter HVSP mode.
- Updated to new USB driver.

* Release 2007-12-01

- Added avrdoper-vista.inf file for Windows Vista.
- Switched back to old hvspEnterProgmode() routine -- seems to work more
  reliably than the one described in the ATTiny45 data sheet.

* Release 2008-02-05

- Assigned a serial number -- this should help to assign a consistent COM
  device regardless of the USB port used.
- Reworked ISP clock delay function so that it never goes below the given
  delay.
- Moved evaluation of received data into main loop. This reduces load
  produced by USB interrupt slightly, since an ACK can be sent while commands
  are executed.
- Added -DMETABOARD_HARDWARE=1 option for programmers based on Metaboard
  (see http://www.obdev.at/goto.php?t=metaboard-prog).
- Added -DUSBASP_HARDWARE=1 option to provide alternative firmware for
  Thomas Fischl's USBasp hardware (see http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/). 
- Reduced interrupt-disabled section in timer interrupt.
- Image formats of schematics and board are now generated automatically from
  EAGLE design.

* Release 2008-04-26

- Previous release introduced a bug on AVR-Doper hardware: LED was not
  configured as output. Fixed.

* Release 2008-04-27

- Fixed report ID for debug data HID interface. This interface is not in use
  because no host side driver exists (yet).
- Fixed interface detection for Metaboard/USBasp hardware.
- Don't configure Timer 1 for USBasp hardware.

* Release 2008-11-27
