This is the README file for AVR-Doper.

AVR-Doper is an STK500 compatible In-System Programmer (ISP) and High Voltage
Serial Programmer (HVSP). It comes with a built-in USB to Serial adaptor to
connect directly to USB.


========
Features
========

* HVSP allows using RESET pin for I/O, which is especially beneficial on
  8 and 14 pin devices.
* Simple hardware which can be built on a single sided PCB. No special USB
  chips are needed.
* Compatible to Atmel's STK500 with built-in USB to Serial converter.
* Adjustable ISP clock allows flashing of devices clocked at very low rate,
  e.g. 32 kHz.
* ISP clock can be lowered with a jumper (if the programmer software does not
  support setting the ISP clock).
* Second USB to Serial converter for processing debug output from the target.
* HVSP connector compatible to HVProg, another STK500 compatible programmer
  (see http://www.der-hammer.info/hvprog/index_en.htm).
* Open Source (including firmware and schematics).
* Uses USB power supply, no external supply required.
* Can be used as alternative firmware on metaboard based programmer, see
  http://www.obdev.at/goto?t=metaboard-prog
* Can be used as alternative firmware for Thomas Fischl's USBasp hardware,
  see http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/

WARNING
=======

AVR-Doper can be used in two modes: (1) With a built-in USB to serial
converter and (2) with a special communication protocol based on the USB HID
standard.

The built-in USB to serial converter does not work with all PC hardware and
all operating systems. We therefore STRONGLY recommend that you use AVR-Doper
in HID mode. This mode uses a different communication protocol on USB and
requires special programming software. It is supported by the Open Source
command line tool "avrdude" since version 5.3. Older versions can be patched,
see the file Readme.txt in the subdirectory "avrdude" for more information.

===========================
Using AVR-Doper in HID Mode
===========================

AVR-Doper can be run in two modes, see the warning section above. We
recommend that you use it in HID mode with "avrdude" as the programming
tool. In order to set the hardware into this mode, set jumper "USB HID".
Use "avrdoper" as the hardware port for avrdude, e.g.:

    avrdude -c stk500v2 -P avrdoper -p atmega8

HID-Mode does not work with Atmel's AVR-Studio 4 because Atmel does not
implement our special HID-based protocol.


=====================================================
Using AVR-Doper with Built-In USB to Serial Converter
=====================================================

This mode is strongly discouraged, see the warning section above. If you
still decide to use it (e.g. because it works well with your components),
remove the "USB HID" jumper from the circuit. AVR-Doper will then present
itself as an USB modem to the operating system. This modem interface uses
the same communication protocol as the original serial STK500 board described
in Atmel's application note AVR068. In this mode, AVR-Doper can be used with
any software which supports the STK500 in firmware revision 2, including
Atmel's AVR-Studio 4 and the Open Source command line tool avrdude.

** WINDOWS **
To use AVR-Doper in this mode on Windows, you must first install drivers for
its CDC-ACM class USB to Serial converter. Luckily, these drivers are part of
Windows. To activate these drivers for AVR-Doper, connect the device. Windows
will bring up a "new hardware" assistant. Proceed as follows:

  + Do not connect to Windows Update to search for a driver.
  + Insert a medium with the "avrdoper.inf" file or have the file available
    somewhere on your computer.
  + If the assistant can't find a medium with avrdoper.inf, it will ask for
    a folder where this file resides. Answer this question.
  + Choose "simple installation". Windows will warn you that the software,
    which shall be installed, has not passed the "Windows Logo" test. This
    is interesting, since the drivers are provided by Microsoft themselves.
    Continue the installation in spite of the aggressive warnings.

When the assistant has finished, a new COM port (it was COM5 on our computer)
is available. Start AVR Studio 4 (available for Free from www.atmel.com) and
test the programmer.

Since Windows Vista, the operating system enforces the USB standard and
forbids bulk endpoints on low speed devices. Osamu Tamura has a driver which
solves this problem by mapping the bulk endpoints to interrupt endpoints.
See http://www.obdev.at/goto.php?t=lowbulk for details.

** Mac OS X **
On Mac OS X, just connect the device. It will be recognized by the operating
system and be accessible as /dev/cu.usbmodem???? where "????" stands for a
combination of digits and letters. Test it with avrdude 5, e.g.:

    avrdude -c stk500v2 -P /dev/cu.usbmodem* -p atmega8

** Linux **
Just connect the device. It will be available as /dev/ttyACM0. Test with
avrdude as above.


=====================
Building the Hardware
=====================

AVR-Doper's hardware should be easy to build. All components are easy to
obtain, except maybe the 1 mH inductor. You can replace it with any inductor
in the range 330 uH to 10 mH. Be SURE TO CHECK the 12 V at the cathode of D3
before you use HVSP. If the voltage exceeds the range 11 V - 13 V, you can
either tune the voltage divider R5/R18 or change the reference constant in the
firmware (see vreg.c, constant "VREG_REF").

The 3.6 V zener diodes D1 and D2 should be low power types. If you can't get
hold of low power zener diodes, you may have to use 3.9 V types due to the
round edge of the cut-off voltage found in low voltage zener diodes.

If you don't want the HVSP feature, you can omit many of the analog components:
L1, T1 - T5, D3, D4, R4, R5, R12 - R16, R18, C2, C7, the programming sockets
IC3 and IC4 and the 20 pin HVSP connector.


=====================
Building the Firmware
=====================

AVR-Doper ships with a ready-made hex-file containing the firmware. Flash it
with whatever programmer you get hold of. If you don't have a programmer yet,
have a look at the simple "parallel port" programming adapters available on
the internet. Please note that you must also change the fuse bytes of the
ATMega8. See the main Makefile (search for "fuse") for the hexadecimal fuse
values and for the options we require.

If you want to compile from the sources, you need avr-gcc, the GNU compiler
for the AVR platform. On Windows, download WinAVR, an integrated development
environment including avr-gcc and all associated tools
(http://winavr.sourceforge.net/). For the Mac, we recommend AVR MacPack
available from http://www.obdev.at/avrmacpack/. On other platforms you need to
compile avr-gcc and avr-libc from the sources. Please read the instructions at
http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/install_tools.html for how to
install all this stuff.

Once you have avr-gcc installed, just type "make" in the "firmware" directory
to build the code.


=====================
Building the Software
=====================

AVR-Doper comes with only one software tool and even this is optional: the
debug logger "avrdebug". This tool requires libusb (on Unix) or libusb-win32
(on Windows). You may have to edit the Makefile to compile it on Windows.

"avrdebug" takes no command line parameters. It simply searches for AVR-Doper
on the USB, attaches to the device and logs all debug data received at the
programmer's RxD line. Each line of ASCII input is prefixed with a timestamp.

Tips and Tricks
===============

Firmware Update
AVR-Doper has no ISP socket to flash AVR-Doper's own firmware. You must
therefore move the ATMega8 to an external programmer for initial firmware
flashing. This can be tedious if you work on AVR-Doper's firmware. We can
highly recommend Thomas Fischl's boot loader in this case. The new firmware is
simply flashed over AVR-Doper's own USB port. See
http://www.fischl.de/avrusbboot/ for details.

Tuning Code Size
The AVR-Doper firmware fits easily into an ATMega8, but not together with a
boot loader. If you want to use a boot loader, you must disable at least one
feature (such as e.g. the HID interface). This can be done in the header file
hardware.h.

External Programming Socket
The ISP interface can supply an external stand-alone programming socket with
power and processor clock. You must set jumper JP1 to connect the ISP power
to the programmer's power supply. The processor clock is available at ISP
pin 3, which was otherwise used for a programming indicator LED.

Debugging Target Firmware
AVR-Doper has an additional USB to Serial converter which reads serial data
from the ISP connector's pin 10. This pin is normally ground. If you connect
your target's TxD (via a resistor to protect it from short circuit) to this
pin, you can read the debug output with the "avrdebug" command line tool.
The debug baud rate is 19200 bps (fixed).

Setting ISP clock
AVR-Doper uses a moderate ISP clock (~ 100 kHz) after power-up. You can
change the ISP clock in AVR Studio's "Board" settings or with the "-B" option
in avrdude (since version 5.1). If your programming software does not support
setting the ISP clock, set jumper JP2 to reduce the ISP clock to ~ 7 kHz,
suitable for CPU clock rates down to 32 kHz. Note that the "-B" option of
avrdude is not exactly in microseconds. For serial clocks of ~ 300 kHz / 100
kHz / 50 kHz use values 1.1, 2 and 3. Higher "-B" values give a ISP clock of
~ 3 microseconds * value.
